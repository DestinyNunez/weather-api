# ðŸŒ¦ Project: Weather API

### Goal: Enable your user to enter a city + country and return the temperature in Fahrenheit

### How It's Made
For this project I used HTML for the structure. I then styled it with CSS and used the Flexbox framework to position elements where they needed to be on the page.
